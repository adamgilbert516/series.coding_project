### INTRODUCTION TO ARRAYS!! :)

## A array? huh? An array is perhaps one of the most basic
#  ways of storing data in computer science. An array is a list. The list can be of numbers,
#  strings, or anything else. Python has a really nice a smooth way of dealing with arrays.
#  A variable can store an array in the same way that a variable can store a single number or
#  a single string. Here is how an array can be created in python:
#			A = []
#  Not so bad. How do I make it? Let's say I wanted to make the list [3,1,-4,6,7]. I could do This
#  several ways. Here is the first way:		
#			A[0]=3
#			A[1]=1
#			A[2]=-4
#			A[3]=6
#			A[4]=7
#  The number inside the bracket represents the 'index' of the array. A[0] refers to the first
#  element in the array. Since this array has a length of 5, its last element can be represented
#  as A[4]. Another way you could create an array is as follows:
#			A=[3,1,-4,6,7]

def find_maximum(list):
# Hi Charlie. This function is called find_maximum.
# Purpose: To find the maximum value in a list and return it.
# Input: a list of numbers
# Output: the maximum value in the list

	# Write your code here...

def find_minimum(list):
# This function has the same purpose, input, and output as the function above
# except you want to find the minimum value in the list.

	# Write your code here...

def sort(list):
# This function is called sort.
# Purpose: sorts a list in increasing order starting with the smallest value on the left increasing
#  to the largest value on the right.
# Input: an unsorted list
# Output: a sorted list

	# Write your code here...

if __name__ == '__main__':
	# Test your functions here!
