def fibonacci(n):
# Write a function called 'fibonacci'.
# Purpose: It takes in a positive integer, n, and returns the value of the n'th 
#	number in the fibonacci sequence. This can be done in 2 lines of code :)
# Input: a positive integer, n, that represents the n'th number in the fibonacci
#	sequence.
# Output: the n'th number in the fibonacci sequence (which is 1,1,2,3,5,8,13). In
#	the fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of the previous two numbers.
# ** The results should look like this:
#		fibonacci(0)=1
#		fibonacci(1)=1
#		fibonacci(2)=2
#		fibonacci(3)=3
#		fibonacci(4)=5
